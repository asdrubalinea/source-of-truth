# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should the new Niri rice be added alongside the existing estradiol rice (keeping both)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users may want to switch between different window managers)

## Q2: Will this Niri rice be used on both desktop (orchid) and laptop (tempest) hosts?

**Default if unknown:** Yes (user explicitly requested preserving all keybindings and functionality)

## Q4: Do we need to adapt any Hyprland-specific scripts or integrations for Niri?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (there's a custom clamshell script and other integrations that may need adaptation)

## Q5: Should the Niri rice use the same aesthetic theme (Rose Pine) as estradiol?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintaining consistency with the estradiol rice aesthetic)
